# MCP Server Execution Playbook (Sequential PR Stack)

## Goal

Ship a production-safe, hosted MCP server for Durabull that supports read-only diagnostics for jobs, failures, logs, and root-cause context, with:

- Better Auth as the auth foundation.
- OAuth 2.1 + scoped bearer token authorization for remote MCP.
- Cloud-hosted and self-hosted deployment paths.
- Strict safety controls so destructive operations cannot run accidentally.

This playbook is designed for **sequential agent execution** with clear handoffs and a running history.

## Required Companion Document

Before executing any PR in this stack, agents must read:

- `tasks/mcp-implementation-master-plan.md`

Usage split:

- `tasks/mcp-implementation-master-plan.md` = technical implementation details ("how")
- `tasks/mcp-pr-execution-playbook.md` = sequencing, ownership, validation history ("when/who")

## Non-Negotiable Constraints

- Do not skip PR order.
- Every PR must be mergeable independently.
- Every PR must include tests and verification evidence.
- No write/destructive MCP tools in this stack (read-only GA target).
- Each PR must link to a Linear issue before merge.

## Hosting model (authoritative — read before PR-02)

MCP is **not** a separate deployable in phase 1. It runs on the **same origin and same process** as the main Durabull API + web app.

| Path | Handler |
| --- | --- |
| `/api/*` | API routes (`apps/api`) |
| `/mcp` | MCP Streamable HTTP (`apps/api/src/mcp/*` mounted in `createApiApp()`) |
| `/ingest/*` | PostHog proxy (existing) |
| `/`, `/assets/*` | Web SPA/static (`apps/api/src/index.ts`) |

Cloud example: `https://app.durabull.io/mcp` on the same Render web service as `https://app.durabull.io/api/*`.

**Agent rules:**

- Implement MCP under `apps/api/src/mcp/`, not as a standalone `apps/mcp` server.
- Mount `/mcp` in `apps/api/src/app.ts` before SPA/static fallbacks.
- Do not add a second public port (`3020`) or dual-process Docker entrypoints for MCP.
- OAuth canonical resource URI (PR-03+): `${APP_BASE_URL}/mcp`.
- Domain logic stays in shared services; MCP handlers are thin ingress only.

If a branch still has experimental `apps/mcp` or `tooling/docker/run-services.ts`, PR-02 must migrate/remove that layout as part of API ingress work (see master plan §13.1).

## Skateboard Approach (Incremental Product Slices)

Each PR must deliver a usable, testable increment:

1. Security model + contracts are explicit.
2. MCP transport is mounted at `/mcp` on the API app and is callable on the same origin.
3. Auth discovery and token validation work end-to-end.
4. Policy/scopes enforce least privilege.
5. Read-only tools deliver customer value.
6. Ops hardening and deployment complete production readiness.

## PR-02: API-Mounted MCP Ingress + Transport

### Objective

Mount MCP Streamable HTTP transport at `/mcp` on the existing `apps/api` Hono app (same deployment/port as API + web), with basic lifecycle and no privileged domain tools yet.

### Deliverables

- [ ] MCP module under `apps/api/src/mcp/` (server bootstrap, transport, route wiring).
- [ ] `/mcp` mounted in `createApiApp()` with correct middleware ordering (before SPA/static `*` fallbacks).
- [ ] Streamable HTTP on `/mcp` (`GET` + `POST` + `DELETE` per SDK).
- [ ] Host header validation including production host from `APP_BASE_URL`.
- [ ] MCP SDK dependencies on `@durabull/api` (not a separate MCP app package).
- [ ] Minimal smoke tool (non-domain `ping`) for transport validation.
- [ ] Remove or migrate any experimental standalone `apps/mcp` + dual-process Docker runner from the branch.

### File Targets

- [ ] `apps/api/src/mcp/server.ts` (McpServer + tool registration)
- [ ] `apps/api/src/mcp/routes.ts` or `apps/api/src/mcp/mount.ts` (transport + middleware)
- [ ] `apps/api/src/app.ts` (mount `/mcp`)
- [ ] `apps/api/package.json` (MCP SDK deps)
- [ ] `apps/api/src/mcp/*.test.ts` or `apps/api/src/app.mcp.test.ts`
- [ ] `tooling/docker/Dockerfile` (single API entrypoint; no MCP second port)
- [x] `docs/adr/0001-mcp-security-architecture.md` (landed in PR-08; unified `/mcp` placement)

### Out of scope (explicit)

- [ ] Standalone `apps/mcp` deployable package
- [ ] Separate public port `3020` in compose/production
- [ ] `tooling/docker/run-services.ts` dual-process supervisor
- [ ] Production diagnostic tools (PR-05)

### Tests

- [ ] API integration test via `createApiApp()`:
  - [ ] `POST /mcp` `initialize` succeeds with required MCP headers
  - [ ] `tools/list` includes `ping`
  - [ ] `tools/call` ping returns `pong`
- [ ] Invalid host header on `/mcp` returns 403
- [ ] Optional: stateful session header behavior test (`MCP_STATEFUL_SESSIONS` or equivalent)
- [ ] Regression: `/mcp` is not captured by SPA static fallback (`GET /mcp` not `index.html`)

### Verification Commands

- [ ] `bun run --filter @durabull/api test` (MCP tests)
- [ ] `bun run --filter @durabull/api typecheck`
- [ ] `bun run --filter @durabull/api lint`
- [ ] Local manual smoke: API port `POST http://localhost:3000/mcp` (initialize + ping)

### Exit Criteria

- [ ] Remote/local client can call `ping` at `{baseUrl}/mcp` on the **same port** as the API (for example `http://localhost:3000/mcp`).

---

## PR-03: OAuth Discovery + Token Validation Middleware

### Objective

Implement spec-aligned auth discovery and request authentication for remote MCP on `/mcp` (same origin as API).

### Deliverables

- [ ] Protected Resource Metadata endpoint (`.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` pathing on app origin).
- [ ] `WWW-Authenticate` challenge responses with metadata URL on unauthenticated `/mcp` requests.
- [ ] Bearer token requirement on **every** MCP request to `/mcp` (`GET`, `POST`, `DELETE`).
- [ ] Audience/resource binding validation against `${APP_BASE_URL}/mcp`.
- [ ] 401/403 semantics aligned to spec.
- [ ] Canonical resource URI handling documented for operators and client config.

### File Targets

- [ ] `apps/api/src/mcp/auth/*` (or equivalent)
- [ ] `apps/api/src/app.ts` (well-known routes if mounted at app root)
- [ ] tests under `apps/api/src/mcp/` or `apps/api/src/routes/`

### Tests

- [ ] Unauthenticated request gets 401 + proper challenge header.
- [ ] Invalid token gets 401.
- [ ] Wrong audience/resource token gets 401.
- [ ] Missing scope gets 403 with precise scope challenge.
- [ ] Valid token path succeeds.

### Verification

- [ ] End-to-end auth flow test from a sample MCP client fixture.

### Exit Criteria

- [ ] MCP requests cannot execute without valid scoped bearer auth.

---

## PR-04: Principals + Policy Engine (Least Privilege Core)

### Objective

Add principal resolution and authorization policy enforcement for both identity models.

- [ ] Policy decision audit fields (`principal`, `org`, `connection`, `scope`, `tool`, `decision`).

### Data/Schema Work

- [ ] Add required DAL schema/migration for service accounts and policy bindings.
- [ ] Add repository methods with tests.

### Tests

- [ ] User principal with proper org access succeeds.
- [ ] Cross-org access denied.
- [ ] Service account with down-scoped token can only access allowed tools.
- [ ] Revoked/rotated service account secret fails auth.

### Exit Criteria

- [ ] Every tool call passes through a centralized policy decision point.

### File Targets

- [ ] `apps/api/src/mcp/policy/*` (or `apps/api/src/mcp/*`)
- [ ] `packages/dal/*` migrations/repositories for service accounts

- [ ] Stable error taxonomy (`validation_error`, `forbidden`, `not_found`, etc.).
- [ ] Annotate read-only hints in tool metadata.
- [ ] Register tools in `apps/api/src/mcp/server.ts` (or sibling module); call shared domain services only.

### File Targets

- [ ] shared domain adapters (`apps/api/src/lib/domain/*` or `packages/mcp-domain`)
- [ ] existing API route modules reused via adapters (not duplicated Hono handler logic)

### Tests

- [ ] Contract tests for each tool schema and response shape.
- [ ] Tool output tests for representative failed jobs.
- [ ] Large log pagination tests.
- [ ] Failure explanation composition tests.

### Exit Criteria

### Deliverables

- [x] Cloud deployment docs updated (Render single web service; `https://app.durabull.io/mcp`).
- [x] Self-host Docker/compose docs: one port, `/mcp` path (remove `MCP_PORT` / `:3020` publish if present).
- [x] Environment variable contract (`APP_BASE_URL`, MCP telemetry/rate-limit notes; MCP always on — no enable flag).
- [x] TLS and ingress guidance: path-based `/mcp` on app domain (no second hostname required).
- [x] Operator runbook for key rotation, auth failures, and MCP client URL configuration.
- [x] Dashboards/metrics definitions for `/mcp` auth failures and tool error rates on unified service.

- [x] Release checklist and rollback procedure included.

### Full Validation Suite

- [ ] End-to-end delegated-user flow from supported MCP client (operator — staging).
- [ ] End-to-end service-account automation flow (operator — staging).
- [x] Negative test suite (invalid token, wrong audience, wrong scope, cross-org attempt) — automated; see security closure.
- [ ] Regression suite across existing API behavior touched by shared modules.
- [ ] Soak test for logs/stacktrace-heavy usage (post-GA).

### Exit Criteria

- [ ] MCP read-only GA approved for production rollout (after operator gates + security sign-off).

#### Handoff To Next PR

- Next PR: `PR-04`
- Known risks: RFC 8707 `resource` binding on opaque tokens is not persisted at issuance yet (`resource` column ready; wire in token handler when enabling full OAuth client flows).
- Notes for next agent: add principal resolver + policy engine; enforce org/connection boundaries on tool calls.

### PR Record: PR-04

- PR ID: `PR-04`
- Branch: `feat/no-linear-mcp-pr04-principals-policy-engine`
- Linear issue: `NO-LINEAR (temporary)`
- PR URL: https://github.com/durabullhq/durabull/pull/94
- Status: `merged`
- Agent owner: `codex`
- Start date: `2026-05-26`
- Merge date: `2026-05-27`

#### Scope Completed

- [x] Principal resolver implemented for delegated users and OAuth-linked service accounts.
- [x] Central policy decision point added in MCP ingress middleware for every `tools/call`.
- [x] Org + connection boundary checks enforced in policy evaluation.
- [x] Service account + policy + audit DAL schema/migration added (`mcp_service_account*`, `mcp_policy_binding`, `mcp_audit_event`).
- [x] Repository support added for service-account lookup, policy bindings, and audit writes.
- [x] Service-account credential hashing + rotation path added (`mcpPolicyRepository.issueServiceAccountSecret/rotateServiceAccountSecret`).
- [x] Integration tests added for delegated and service-account policy enforcement through `/mcp`.
- [x] Request-scoped principal context plumbed into MCP tool execution path.

#### Verification Evidence

- [x] Commands run:
  - [x] `bun test packages/dal/src/repositories/mcp-policy.test.ts`
  - [x] `bun run --filter @durabull/api test src/mcp/mount.test.ts`
  - [x] `bun run --filter @durabull/dal typecheck`
  - [x] `bun run --filter @durabull/dal lint`
  - [ ] `bun run --filter @durabull/api typecheck` (blocked by pre-existing `alerts-global.test.ts` unknown-body typing errors)
- [x] Tests added:
  - [x] `packages/dal/src/repositories/mcp-policy.test.ts`
  - [x] Expanded `apps/api/src/mcp/mount.test.ts` with service-account allow/deny and delegated cross-org boundary cases.
- [x] Security checks:
  - [x] No destructive MCP tools introduced.
  - [x] Service-account policy bindings required for tool execution.
  - [x] Policy audit records persisted for allow + deny decisions.

#### Handoff To Next PR

- Next PR: `PR-05`
- Known risks (historical):
  - Domain read tools landed in PR-05 (#97).
  - RFC 8707 issuance binding follow-up from PR-03 still open.
- Follow-up tasks:
  - finalize PR-01 documentation fold-in artifacts before/with PR-04 PR description.
  - attach Linear issue IDs retroactively if required by merge policy.
- Notes for next agent:
  - keep policy as the single authorization gate for MCP tool calls.
  - register PR-05 read-only tools with explicit scope requirements and connection-bound checks.

#### Handoff To Next PR

- Next PR: `PR-06` (safety hardening)
- Known risks (historical — superseded by PR-06):
  - MCP output redaction was minimal before PR-06 central sanitizer.
- Follow-up tasks:
  - land remaining tools on `feat/mcp-pr05-remaining-read-tools` (`get_failure_events`, `get_queue_metrics`, `get_workers`, `explain_job_failure`).
- Notes for next agent:
  - keep all MCP tools read-only and route through existing policy middleware.
  - preserve request-context bridge; do not bypass principal/policy/audit path when adding tools.

#### PR-05 continuation (`feat/mcp-pr05-remaining-read-tools`)

- [x] `get_failure_events` (`mcp:failures:read`) with paginated alert events + sanitized context.
- [x] `get_queue_metrics` (`mcp:diagnostics:read`) with bounded summary (no Prometheus/raw series export).
- [x] `get_workers` (`mcp:jobs:read`) with queue-scoped worker snapshots.
- [x] `explain_job_failure` (`mcp:diagnostics:read` + `mcp:jobs:read` + `mcp:logs:read` + `mcp:failures:read`) deterministic composed summary.
- [x] Policy scope mappings + `tools/list` integration tests updated.
- [x] Unit tests: `explain-job-failure-handler.test.ts`, policy scope mapping test.

#### Handoff To Next PR

- Next PR: `PR-08`
- Known risks: staging deploy smoke must be run by operator with live credentials (not automated in CI for this PR).
- Notes for next agent: PR-08 GA docs; operator E2E on staging per release checklist.
